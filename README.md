# Expense Tracker

## Expense Tracker
The Expense Tracker is a web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS that allows users to easily track and manage their expenses. The application includes a user-friendly interface with various features such as adding expenses, filtering expenses by year, and visualizing expenses using a bar chart.

## Features
* Add expenses: The application provides a simple and intuitive form that allows users to enter details of a new expense including title, amount, and date. Once the form is submitted, the new expense is added to the list of expenses displayed below.

* Filter expenses by year: The application includes a filter component that allows users to select a specific year to filter their expenses. The drop-down menu in the filter component displays all available years for which expenses have been added. When a user selects a year from the drop-down menu, the application filters the expenses list and only shows the expenses for the selected year.

* Visualize expenses using a bar chart: The application includes a bar chart that displays the percentage of monthly expenses for each month of the selected year. This visualization helps users to understand their monthly expenses and identify areas where they may need to adjust their spending.
